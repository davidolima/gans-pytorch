# Generative Adversarial Networks in PyTorch
This repository is the implementation of some architectures of GANs.
I'll be working on this repository on and off, but the plan is to implement the following:
 - DCGAN
 - ConditionalGAN
 - WGAN
 - WGAN-GP

# Running
## Install requirements

``` python
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## MNIST Dataset
``` python
python3 mnist.py
```
